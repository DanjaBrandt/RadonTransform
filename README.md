# RadonTransform

Radon Transform based algorithm to detect oriented structures in microscopy images.  

The algorithm is described in the paper: [Segmentation-free Radon transform algorithm to detect orientation and size of tissue structures in multiphoton microscopy images](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-30/issue-8/086001/Segmentation-free-Radon-transform-algorithm-to-detect-orientation-and-size/10.1117/1.JBO.30.8.086001.full).  
Example data used in this paper can be found [here](https://github.com/DanjaBrandt/RadonTransform/tree/main/applications/00_orientation_detection).
